                            of admission was rough and working with the interface provided by the Universities
                            websites added to that stress. So a group of friends and I decided to simplify the process
                            of acquiring our basic student information by making a google chrome extension. We used
                            tools like HTML, CSS, Jquery in order to indentify, reccomend, and prioritize new web
                            features and applications in conjunction with the Iowa State Univerity student information
                            website <a href="https://accessplus.iastate.edu/servlet/adp.A_Plus">AccessPlus</a>. The

                            my team and I created a Model View Controller Web Application and integrated a Mobile
                            Application to communicate effectively with the MvC via Json. The Web application provided
                            an interface where users could create their own job form and save it to their
                            own profile via a SQL database. The user can then access his/her forms
                            from their phones since the MvC Web app automatically saves their data to the
                            database. I was in charge of developing the IOS version of the mobile application. Using
                            Swift the app could fetch the data coming from the Web App and use it for display or

                            essentially the program provided a dashboard where all job request were being displayed and

                    <ul>
                        <li style="text-transform: none;"><p>
                            Early in my career as an engineering student I found myself thinking what kind of engineer and person I would like to form myself to be. As graduation is just around the corner the answer to that is now that I wish to be a type of engineer that develop technology that can efficiently affect people in a positive manner. Engineering in general is a field where it requires a lot of logic and mathematics which can easily overshadow the concept of culture, philosophy, and ethics. Which on their own are fields that should be respected individually. So, in order to kickstart my career as an engineer I decided to take PSYCH 101 which is a class that explains the fundamentals of human psychology and what we think certain thought pattern might mean in the world of both science and philosophy. This class gave me the foundation to start think about the different psychological aspects an engineer must consider when developing a project that affects human lives. This also helped me in understanding people which lead me to be a better team member when working on group projects. Furthermore, in the aspect logical development I believe ECON 101 has helped me in considering cost when executing something. Especially when writing course, even though coding is never presented in this course. It still helped me in considering redundancy and efficiency when writing my code as performance is treated as a cost. A real life example on how it has helped as an engineer is in an experience I had in an internship where my project had a lot to do with how well the software can perform I order to efficiently use the data being fetch without any performance issues. This led me to consider every variable in a cautious matter as one useless variable might lead to redundancy and performance drops. Another thing I also consider was culture and interested the country of Russia and Latino America, so I decided to take RUS 375 and now US LS 211 (which is US Latino Studies) there I learned the different aspects of how another entirely different country operates. I believe that as an engineer one must consider the well being of others when developing a project. Not only must one consider how will the project help the company and the individuals in the company but one’s community as a whole.

                    <p>Ethics Essay:</p>

                        <li style="text-transform: none;">
                        <p>Theranos is one of these case studies where it surprised me how much it took for the case to be debunked. It is the fundamental example of what a company operated by an extreme narcissist looks like. Theranos was a company founded by Elizabeth Holmes. She was a Stanford drop out student that focused on figuring out a way to make blood analysis in a more efficient matter. Throughout the years of her rising up she managed to gain multiple funding from multiple investors, which proved to be quite fruitful as by 2015, Theranos became one of the wealthiest startups in the country allowing Elizabeth Holmes to have a NET worth of 9 billion dollars. This is was huge at the time, Elizabeth Holmes was considered the most influential woman on tech making huge leaps for the medical field and the crazy thing is that all of it was a lie. By 2016 reports came in from multiple ex-Theranos employees explicitly explaining that what Theranos provided simply did not work and how Elizabeth Holmes operated the company was more of a tyrannical way of operating, firing anyone who doubted the flawed results that the company was producing. By the end of the year Theranos was no more and Elizabeth Holmes lost all of her NET worth, making Theranos one of the biggest disappointments of the twenty first century. The way this happened is a case that is still being studied to this day, but the obvious remarks were that the CEO, Elizabeth Holmes does contain some psychological issues like extreme narcissism. 
                            Putting myself in the shoes of those engineers I can honestly say that I would not be associated in anything that company produces. If I were to logically think about the different ways of operation that a company performs from day to day, I feel like a company like Theranos can be easily exposable. However, the issue relies on how directly associated individuals are with the company’s grander projects and higher ups. One can speculate that the work environment in which Theranos operated was not a very communication-based environment. Not everyone had the access to speak with the higher ups whenever they pleased. So, as an engineer there I would have been difficult for me to find any exposure of falsehood in our project. 
                            That’s the reason I believe a lot of the engineers in Theranos did what they were signed up to do, even though they did not gain to valuable results. I truly believe that there is no possible way that a high number of smart individuals would work multiple years for a caused that they knew will never come to fruition. This was the case of mass manipulation and lack of communication between engineers and higher ups. This was the work of someone who simply did not value technological impact on individuals and was simply worked to become recognized as one of the big tech gurus of the twenty first century. The engineers working for Theranos were subjects of manipulation and should be blamed in any form unless proved otherwise. Overall Theranos was a completely unethical situation, executed by individuals that suffer from sever sociopathic tendencies.

These have allowed me to expand on my engineering skills in the actual work force. Not only that but it has provided me the opportunity to expand my professional outlook, via by speaking to recruiters from companies around the world.

                           <p><b>What things have you done at ISU to prepare you to: </b> <br/> During my internship experiences. the project that I worked required me to consider the user based that the end product will eventaully impact. ISU allowed me to view projects as ethical as possible, the courses taken allowed me to have an insight what users would need and what they would want. Which also expanded with my work colleagues. When working one must consider his or her work collegues as people with their own life sitautions so one must be vigilant in order to work with them properly.</p>

                               Yes, in many cases I found myself searching for outside knowledge about the subject at hand, especially in the first few years of being in college. When programming classes were difficult I found myself reading in the ISU library about the subjects that the course was discussing. Books like "The C programming language" provided by the ISU livrary have provided me an immense amount of help in my courses.</p>

                            <p><b>How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5 credits), such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate Research Experience (REU), or other university programs help you to understand the importance of Lifelong Learning?  </b> <br/>Career Fairs have allowed me gain so much experience with the work force. Not only that but naturally I am a shy individual so it also allowed me to go against my nature and become a more extroverted person. Furthermore, career fairs have allowed me land many internship opportunities which have
                                expanded me as an engineer much more than my time in class.

Please explain.  </b> <br/>Yes, I had taken many multiple online courses aside from my classes and work. Courses concenring about Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have provided me a clearer view at the knowledge provided me in some of my courses. Not only that but tackling a complicated subject such as Artificial Intelligence forced me to become a more self-aware engineer and to think about the code being done.

                                I believe I would have taken more cyber security courses and even would have taken a minor for it. As towards the end of my student career I have taken some of the courses provided and grew a linking and understading towards the subject.</p>
